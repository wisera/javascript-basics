// Primitive types are value types, for example, a variable can have a string as a value,
// in that case it is a primitive type, because a string is a primitive type
// Primitives/ Value types include: string, number, boolean, undefined, and null
// undefined type is when you decalre a variable w/out a value ex.:

let age;

// the variable age in this case has a primitive of undefined, you can also declare it like this, ex,:

let player = undefined

// the null type is when you want to clear a value of a variable, for example, you may want to create a variable called color
// and let the user assign that variable to what they prefer, so you will assignt it w/ value null
// so later the user can assign that vlaue to somethiong like 'red'

let color = null;

// other examples:

let name = 'Luan' // string literal
let age = 24 // number literal
let isApproved = false; // boolean literal
