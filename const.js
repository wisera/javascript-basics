// to assign a variable w/ a value that doesn't change use const, ex.:

const interestRate = 0.3
console.log(interestRate)

// if you try to assign a new value for this variable you will get an error

// interestRate = 0.9


// Best practice is, use const as a default way to declare variables, only use let if you will reassign a new value to that variable
